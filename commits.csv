Date,UserName,File,Message
2023-09-29 15:09:46 +0400,TheodorHarmse,Theodor Harmse:  Added Client, Server and Tests folders, and __init__.py files so long.  Client.py and Server.py has been added as well, so that initial coding can be done.,"client/__init__.py;client/client.py;server/__init__.py;server/server.py;tests/__init__.py;tests/test_client.py;tests/test_server.py"
2023-09-29 15:23:58 +0400,TheodorHarmse,Theodor Harmse:  Added Commands.txt for our internal use so long. This is to setup a virtual environment for local use (but its for windows, Im not familiar with MacOS if anyone uses that - if you do, please ammend as temp measure).,"Commands.txt;requirements.txt"
2023-09-29 15:47:03 +0400,TheodorHarmse,Theodor Harmse:  Adding SecureFile to be used for encryption so long.  This is the one in the module videos, so we will use this for encryption.,"README.md;requirements.txt"
2023-09-29 20:10:38 +0400,TheodorHarmse,Theodor Harmse:  Added functionality for config files for client and server. Sending "Hello, Liverpool" from client to server to test.- Successful  Encryption and Decryption methods created. As well as method to generate a key.  This will be used next once code is written.  To test, run generate_key.py to create a new key.key file to be used.  The key.key file should not be checked into the code repository.  Only the Server and Client, when hosted, will use this key.,"Utils/generate_key.py;client/client.py;client/client_main.py;client/config/client_config.yaml;common/common_utils.py;common/decryption.py;common/encryption.py;requirements.txt;server/config/server_config.yaml;server/server.py;server/server_main.py"
2023-09-29 22:07:20 +0400,TheodorHarmse,Theodor Harmse:  Front end web client (using flask) and just simple html/javascript for the display.  This will allow the user to add data to the dictionary, allow for using various serialization options to be selected and preview this. The temp file is also created so long if this option is to be selected. Need to still bind/send to server and work on encryption if selected.,"Utils/key.key;client/client_app.py;client/static/main.js;client/templates/index.html;client/utils/create_text_file.py;requirements.txt"
2023-09-30 00:18:34 +0400,TheodorHarmse,Theodor Harmse:  Updated code so that Client sends data to server for XML, JSON or Binary (Base64 ).  Accessing the key has been shifted to the encryption and decryption python files to keep the logic centrally there for future use.,"Utils/generate_key.py;client/client_app.py;client/client_main.py;common/decryption.py;common/encryption.py;common/load_config.py;server/server_main.py"
2023-09-30 01:40:29 +0400,TheodorHarmse,Theodor Harmse:  Added logic for handing text files.  From client front end, if the dictionary is loade dand the user selected "Submit as Text file", it will create the text file on the client side, then submit the data as base64 to server.. the server will then save the data to its own text file (exactly the same data as client) and then print unencrypted data if it was encrypted. Updated create_text_file to store to client folder under text_files... and the same will happen on server side under a folder called text_files.  Just keeping the filenames different for now.,"client/client_app.py;client/utils/create_text_file.py;server/server_main.py"
2023-09-30 01:49:59 +0400,TheodorHarmse,Theodor Harmse:  Adding an index.html file to the server side as well, want to have the server side display the messages received from client.  Going to use Flask for this.,"server/templates/index.html"
2023-09-30 02:20:23 +0400,TheodorHarmse,Theodor Harmse:  Updated index.html for server so that it can load received messages from client. Code modified so that display messages can be printed to screen and also to the console (doing appending for better management in code).  Updated server_main.py to use flask and for displayin gmessages as per index.html.  Message updates are done very 2 seconds for now.,"server/server/text_files/received_file.txt;server/server_main.py;server/templates/index.html"
2023-09-30 02:29:00 +0400,TheodorHarmse,Theodor Harmse:  Added a "Clear Messages" button on the server side, just to tidy up.  If we host this, it will run constantly and will just pile up with messages. So just doing this to clean up.,"server/server/text_files/received_file.txt;server/server_main.py;server/templates/index.html"
2023-09-30 02:40:23 +0400,TheodorHarmse,Theodor Harmse:  Moved "The Text File is Saved at" to the bottom, so that file data shows first,"server/server/text_files/received_file.txt;server/server_main.py"
2023-09-30 10:07:00 +0400,TheodorHarmse,Theodor Harmse:  Added Data Format to be sent to server side.  Updated Server Index.html to fix the issue with XML not showing correctly (added escapeHTML function). Updated Server code to assign data format to variable so long.,"client/client_app.py;server/server/text_files/received_file.txt;server/server_main.py;server/templates/index.html"
2023-09-30 10:35:53 +0400,TheodorHarmse,Theodor Harmse:  Writing messages to file. Added a line to the config to read from there if the user wants to see the messages printed or if everything should just be written to a file.  Fixed an issue with directory structure: when an encrypted file was received, it was also written to server/server/Text_file and it should just be Text_file folder under the main server folder.,"server/config/server_config.yaml;server/server/text_files/received_file.txt;server/server_main.py"
2023-09-30 10:59:06 +0400,TheodorHarmse,Theodor Harmse:  Added a Download button so that if the config is for "file" based on the filre_or_print_display, then the messages won't display as print, but written to the all_messages_received.txt file.  This will then allow the user to download this file.  I have also added the path to the file when in "file" mode.,"server/templates/index.html"
2023-09-30 10:59:11 +0400,TheodorHarmse,Theodor Harmse:  Added a Download button so that if the config is for "file" based on the filre_or_print_display, then the messages won't display as print, but written to the all_messages_received.txt file.  This will then allow the user to download this file.  I have also added the path to the file when in "file" mode.,"server/server_main.py"
2023-09-30 11:09:44 +0400,TheodorHarmse,Theodor Harmse:  Added functionality on server side that if the Clear Messages button is pressed, it will clear the file as well, if file mode is used.,"server/server_main.py;server/templates/index.html"
2023-09-30 11:20:48 +0400,TheodorHarmse,Theodor Harmse:  Fix text wrapping issue on Server side when in print mode,"server/config/server_config.yaml;server/templates/index.html"

2023-09-30 11:39:20 +0400,TheodorHarmse,Theodor Harmse:  changed server_main.py to get the file paths from the config.  Updated the server config so store the file paths. Added more comments to sever_main.py for better clarity on parameters and functionality.,"server/config/server_config.yaml;server/server_main.py"
2023-09-30 12:13:33 +0400,TheodorHarmse,Theodor Harmse:  Added University of Liverpool logo, added styling to client and server side to make things look better. Kept the logo's seperate and not central because maybe we want to use 2 seperate logos at some point. Moved the serialization drop down up so that when it displays the serialized data, its under the drop down.  So this will be better for users.,"client/static/images/University_of_Liverpool.jpg;client/templates/index.html;server/config/server_config.yaml;server/static/images/University_of_Liverpool.jpg;server/static/main.js;server/templates/index.html;text_files/all_messages_received.txt;text_files/received_file.txt"
2023-09-30 12:16:21 +0400,TheodorHarmse,Theodor Harmse:  This file shouldn't be here, its for the client side.  When i copied the static/images from client to the server folder, this file came with. I did delete it but seems its back, so just removing on server side.,"server/static/main.js"
2023-09-30 12:18:00 +0400,TheodorHarmse,Theodor Harmse:  Removed University of Liverpool text in heading, because we have the logo now,"server/templates/index.html"

2023-09-30 15:51:28 +0400,TheodorHarmse,Theodor Harmse: updated so that flask uses 0.0.0.0 so we can bind to a public port for hosting as well as having localhost available.,"client/client_app.py;server/server_main.py"
2023-10-01 01:46:40 +0400,TheodorHarmse,Theodor Harmse: Updated server_config to make use of 0.0.0.0 instead of localhost.. because client and server might not be on the same machine and it should be open to listen from anywhere,"server/config/server_config.yaml"

This is so that the user can determine if they want to switch from print mode to file mode, without having to go into the config file to change this functionality.  Added method so that the config is updated correctly and "" is not removed from variables. Updated server index.html to show the checkbox.,"client/text_files/temp_serialized_data.txt;server/config/server_config.yaml;server/server_main.py;server/templates/index.html;server/text_files/received_file.txt;text_files/all_messages_received.txt;text_files/received_file.txt"
2023-10-01 05:07:16 +0400,TheodorHarmse,Theodor Harmse: fixed bug - when loading the server locally, its fine, but when hosted, it was a problem sa it couldn't locate the config.,"client/text_files/temp_serialized_data.txt;server/server_main.py;server/text_files/all_messages_received.txt;server/text_files/received_file.txt"
2023-10-01 19:18:46 +0400,TheodorHarmse,Theodor Harmse: fixed config to make use of \\ rather than / as this creates a problem when creating the file and it disregards "server" as a folder,"client/text_files/temp_serialized_data.txt;server/config/server_config.yaml;server/text_files/all_messages_received.txt;server/text_files/received_file.txt"

2023-10-01 21:50:55 +0400,TheodorHarmse,Theodor Harmse: SERVER: Moved javascript out to main.js, with CSS into its own file styles.css and then index.html to reference these files and for index.html to only hold the html. This is better practice.  Its easier to fix things as well.,"client/text_files/temp_serialized_data.txt;server/static/main.js;server/static/styles.css;server/templates/index.html;server/text_files/all_messages_received.txt;server/text_files/received_file.txt"
